# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-02)

**Core value:** A sarcastic, personality-driven music + AI Discord bot that runs reliably — playing music, answering `/ask`, and generating images without crashes or orphaned FFmpeg processes.
**Current focus:** v1.3 "Taste Brain" — Phase 13: Semantic Music Memory (foundation)

## Current Position

Phase: 13 of 17 (Semantic Music Memory) — first of 5 phases in v1.3
Plan: Not yet planned
Status: Roadmap complete — ready to plan Phase 13
Last activity: 2026-07-02 — ROADMAP.md written for v1.3 (Phases 13-17), REQUIREMENTS.md traceability confirmed (15/15 mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed (v1.3): 0
- v1.0 + v1.1 + v1.2: 52 plans shipped across Phases 1-12 (pre-v1.3) — full per-plan timings archived in milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md and milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md

**By Phase (v1.3):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 13. Semantic Music Memory | 0/TBD | - | - |
| 14. Smarter Music Brain | 0/TBD | - | - |
| 15. RAG Reach | 0/TBD | - | - |
| 16. Proactive Memory Callbacks | 0/TBD | - | - |
| 17. Vision / Multimodal Roasting | 0/TBD | - | - |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log lives in PROJECT.md Key Decisions and the milestone roadmaps. Highlights most relevant to v1.3:

- Layered cog → service → model architecture; services wired in `bot.py:_initialize_once` — `TasteService` (Phase 14) and `cogs/vision.py` (Phase 17) slot in the same way, no redesign.
- `MemoryService.recall/remember/distill` (Phase 11) is kind-agnostic by design — taste episodes (Phase 13) are just a new `kind`, zero code change needed in `services/memory.py`/`models/memory.py`.
- Flavor-vs-numbers split / accuracy firewall (Phase 11, reaffirmed for v1.3): qualitative narrative flows through vector memory; anything that drives a ranking decision (auto-queue, taste-graph adjacency) comes from live SQL, never embedded text.
- Global Gemini 15 RPM limiter with priority tiers; embeddings use a **separate** ~60 RPM limiter (Phase 11) — vision (Phase 17) shares the 15 RPM chat budget at priority 2, not the embed limiter.
- Gemini 2.5-series models default `safety_settings` to OFF when unspecified — vision (Phase 17) must set them explicitly; whether to retrofit `/ask`/`/imagine` is an open decision for that phase (VIS-03).
- `/memory forget` (Phase 15) must ship and be verified as a real hard-delete before proactive callbacks (Phase 16) — the required escape hatch; hard dependency, do not reorder.
- Pure-logic TDD seam (`logic/*.py`, Phase 10 convention): `logic/taste.py` (Phase 14) and `logic/vision.py` (Phase 17) follow the same mock-free pattern.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Parked] The 24/7 live deploy remains parked behind the YouTube datacenter-IP block; unrelated to v1.3 scope. See Deferred Items.
- Phase 16 (proactive callbacks) is hard-blocked on Phase 15's `/memory forget` shipping and being verified as a real deletion — do not reorder or parallelize past this gate.

## Deferred Items

Carried forward from v1.2 milestone close (2026-07-01) — all UAT/verification, all `human_needed` live-Discord checks, zero code gaps. None are in v1.3 scope; all resume when a Pi / always-on residential host exists.

| Category | Item | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| uat | Phase 09 — `09-HUMAN-UAT.md` (6 pending: truthful `/health` degraded, task-failure surfacing live) | Blocked on live Discord/host |
| uat | Phase 11 — `11-HUMAN-UAT.md` (3 pending: live RAG recall + callback-roast behavior) | Blocked on live Discord/host |
| verification | Phase 09/11 — `*-VERIFICATION.md` (`human_needed`) | Blocked on live Discord/host |
| requirement | DEPLOY-02/03/05/08 — standing live-UAT, human-UAT scenarios, restart persistence, keepalive cron all live-in-production | Blocked on 24/7 host |
| uat/verification | Phases 03-06 `*-HUMAN-UAT`/`*-VERIFICATION`/`05-UAT-RUNBOOK.md` — carried v1.1 live-deploy checks | Blocked on 24/7 host |
